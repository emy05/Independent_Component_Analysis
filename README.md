# Independent_Component_Analysis
This repository contains code for the analysis of EEG (Electroencephalography) data using independent component analysis (ICA). 
The primary objective of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the complex and noisy EEG data. To achieve this, a statistical extraction method was employed, involving resampling and mathematical characterization of the temporal waveforms.

The core of the analysis relies on applying independent component analysis (ICA) to disentangle the different sources of brain activity in the EEG data. The analysis is implemented in Python, utilizing popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. The code encompasses data preprocessing, ICA application, and visualization of the resulting independent components.
